# MNTN

MNTN is a modern React project built with **Vite** and enhanced with smooth scrolling, animations, and interactive UI components. The project leverages the latest React 19 features and integrates powerful libraries for a seamless and dynamic user experience.

This project is part of the Pixel Perfect Tutorial: "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Website with Scroll Animations | Complete GSAP + Lenis Guide"

## ‚ú® Description

In this complete tutorial, we will build an impressive modern hiking landing page from scratch using semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and powerful GSAP animations with ScrollTrigger and smooth scrolling with Lenis.

You will learn how to create a fixed header, an animated hero section, layered parallax scroll effects, and smooth section reveals, all fully responsive and optimized for the user interface.
